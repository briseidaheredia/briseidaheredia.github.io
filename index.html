        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Briseida and I am a third year undergraduate studying Psychology at the University of Riverside with an interest in understanding the mind and human behavior. I am a transfer student and before attending UCR, I graduated with an associates degree in Psychology at Moreno Valley Community college, where I began my journey in discovering knowledge when it comes to psychological aspects of our lives. My interests when it comes to academics involve psychology and the area of humanities, all asking the question of why people behave or think a certain way. To be specific, I am mostly drawn to forensic psychology or psychology when we are speaking of legal context and systems. I have always been a curious person since I was a child and am stunned by how there are many factors which have an impact on behavior when it comes to investigative or criminal situations. Although I am focusing on forensic psychology, I find it important to understand many perspectives in psychology. I believe it is good to learn about neuroscience, developmental and abnormal psychology, because understanding all of these can help us get a clearer picture of what is going on inside the human brain.
<br><br>

        At Moreno Valley Community College, I completed coursework in Abnormal Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Biological Psychology, Statistics, Research Methods, and these have all contributed to my knowledge as a psychology student. I have also completed coursework that can strengthen my knowledge such as interpersonal communications. From these courses, I have been able to gain an understanding regarding the different patterns of thinking across a variety of people. It has allowed me to become aware that our environments and genes have an influence on the way we act, think, etc. Outside of college and university, I have been involved in student clubs related to my major such as psychology and neuroscience clubs, and possibly a club that focuses on the criminal system. These clubs have not only allowed me to collaborate and speak with others of the same passions, but it has opened a door for more understanding. By collaborating, I am learning the skills of teamwork and communication especially in academic contexts. One of the things that helped me become certain with my path in psychology is how broad it is and the amount of fields that can be studied within this area. There are also a variety of ways that you can expand your knowledge whether it be through engaging in labs, research projects, assessments, etc. You can expect to gather experience in your area of work by engaging in these activities or simply by speaking with others. 
<br><br>

     My end goal is to be in graduate school studying forensic psychology and land with a career that will involve things such as analysis of human behavior, research, etc. On the outside it may seem like just a professional job but the real goal is to be able to make a change or difference when it comes to the legal/criminal system through psychology. It will be satisfying to delight others with the insight of a human thought and describe the reason for someone’s behavior. To the reader, thank you for your time and for visiting my page. This is only the beginning of my academic journey and career. I look forward to enriching my knowledge when it comes to aspects of psychology and humanity.
